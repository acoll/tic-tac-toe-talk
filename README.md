# tic-tac-toe-talk

Here are three projects that implement the same tic tac toe game. The idea of this example is to show some pros and cons of moving between vanill-js -> react-js -> reason-react.

You'll need to install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to run the projects.

To run any of the projects navigate to the project directory (eg vanill-js).

Install the dependencies with `yarn` and then start the development environment with `yarn dev`;
